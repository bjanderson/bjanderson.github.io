    <h1>Creating NPM Packages</h1>

    <p>
      If you want to build reusable code for the front-end then you need to learn how to build and deploy npm packages.
      You can either choose to use the public npm repository or your own private npm repo, but one thing is certain - if you're doing JavaScript development, then npm is going to be involved in the process somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like everything else we developers do, once you get the hang of it, it's actually a very easy process.
      And the more you do it, the more opportunities you will find for automating things.
      But we must walk before we run...
    </p>

    <p>
      For our first npm package we will make a simple utils library.
      Before we get into the code, we need to decide where the npm package is going to live.
      Will it be available to the public?
      Is it proprietary and need to be protected?
      Or, are you just learning and experimenting?
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll walk you through my process as an example, and that should give you enough information so that you can figure out how to do things your way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I ultimately intend for my utils library to be public, open-source software.
      However, I want to experiment a bit and climb the learning curve before I try pushing anything out to the community.
      So, I'll start by setting up a private npm repo on my computer, and then, when I'm sure my package is ready for prime-time, I'll move it to it's permanent home in the public npm repo.
    </p>

    <h2>Local/Private Repository</h2>

    <h3>Verdaccio</h3>

    <p>
      First I'm going to install an application named Verdaccio (<a href="https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio" target="_blank">https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use Verdaccio as a private repo that your whole team can use, or you can install it on your own machine and use it as a sandbox environment.
      Either way, there's really not much difference in how you use it compared to how you use other private or public npm repos.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      We install Verdaccio through npm:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm i -g verdaccio
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      And we run Verdaccio as an npm application:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        verdaccio
      </code></pre>

      You can also check out the <a href="https://verdaccio.org/docs/en/cli" target="_blank">docs</a> for more cli options.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      Just like any other npm repository, you need to add a user to Verdaccio before you can publish anything:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873
      </code></pre>

      It will prompt you for a username and password.
      If you use Verdaccio as a private repo for your company's proprietary code, then I would suggest setting up a dedicated account to administer it, otherwise you probably just want to make this easy to remember.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      Publish a package to your Verdaccio repo:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873
      </code></pre>

      If you want to make sure that your package does not get published to the public npm repo, I recommend adding the <code class="language-bash">publishConfig</code> setting to your <code class="language-bash">package.json</code> file, like so:
      <pre><code class="language-text">
        ##########
        # package.json
        ##########

        "publishConfig": { "registry": "http://localhost:4873/" }
      </code></pre>

      Note: If you set <code class="language-bash">"private": true</code> in your <code class="language-bash">package.json</code> file then your package won't be deployed anywhere, so make sure to use the <code class="language-bash">publishConfig</code> setting if you're creating a package that you want to publish to your private repo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also worth noting here is the need to keep your package versions updated.
      If you try to publish your package with a version number that already exists in your npm repo, the publish command will fail.
      Thankfully, npm provides a <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version.html" target="_blank">cli command</a> for updating your package version for you, but you can also edit the version number directly in your <code class="language-bash">package.json</code> file if you wish.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      And finally, to install a package from your Verdaccio repo you run it like any other npm install command, but you need to include the registry parameter:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm install my-package --registry http://localhost:4873
      </code></pre>

    </p>

    <p class="step">
      Or you can create a <code class="language-bash">.npmrc</code> file in your project and put the registry setting in it, then you won't have to use the registry flag when you install your package.
      <pre><code class="language-text">
        ##########
        # .npmrc
        ##########

        registry=http://localhost:4873
      </code></pre>
      But, whenever you try to run npm commands in your project, make sure that verdaccio is running or you may get errors saying that your packages can't be found.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      You can also set the registry setting in your global .npmrc file by running:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm set registry http://localhost:4873/
      </code></pre>

      This will make any npm install command on your machine look for your Verdaccio repo, though, so you will have to make sure that Verdaccio is always running.
    </p>

    <h3>Errors</h3>

    <p>
      I've run into errors when I start a new project that depends on a shared library from my company's private npm repo where <code class="language-bash">npm install</code> fails with strange permissions errors.
      Unfortunately the error messages can sometimes be unhelpful or even misleading.
      If you get permissions errors when starting a new project and you are using a private npm repo, make sure you are logged in to the npm repo by running:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm login
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don't have login permissions, you may need to exclude your private dependencies from the initial install, and comment out the registry setting in your <code class="language-bash">.npmrc</code> file, install everything from the public npm repo first, and then try installing your private packages again after everything else succeeds.
    </p>

    <h2>Public Repository</h2>

    <p>
      All of these commands work exactly the same for the public npm repo, except that you don't have to set the registry setting anywhere.
      Commands such as <code class="language-bash">npm install</code> and <code class="language-bash">npm publish</code> all point to the public <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npmjs.com</a> repo by default.
    </p>

    <h2>Create And Deploy Packages</h2>

    <p>
      OK.
      With all of that out of the way, now we can get in to actually creating the package.
    </p>

    <h3>Bare Minimum</h3>

    <p>
      Npm packages don't have to be huge.
      In fact, the only thing that's absolutely required to create one is a <code class="language-text">package.json</code> file with a name and a version.
      Technically, everything else is optional.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, to show you an example of the bare minimum, here's an example <code class="language-text">package.json</code> file that you could publish as an npm package.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        {
          "name": "unique-package-name",
          "version": "0.0.1"
        }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, that is useless, so you will want to add some functionality to your package.
      For the sake of keeping it easy, I'm just going to use a single file that defines a simple function.
      I will name the file <code class="language-text">index.js</code>.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        /** index.js */

        module.exports = function isString(obj) {
          return typeof obj === 'string';
        }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now all we have to do is add that file to our <code class="language-text">package.json</code> file, and we will have a technically complete npm package.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        {
          "name": "unique-package-name",
          "version": "0.0.1",
          "main": "index.js"
        }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Two more things that you should absolutely add to every package you create are a license and a readme.
      The license tells potential users the limitations that you have (or have not) put on who may use your package, and how they can use it.
      The readme should provide an overview of what your package does, and instructions on how to use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank">license</a> should consist of a file named LICENSE, and an additional field in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> file that is set to the tile of your license - e.g. "MIT".
      The readme just needs to be a file named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README" target="_blank">README</a>, which typically contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, but could also just contain plain text.
    </p>

    <p>
      This might seem like a very minimal example, and it is, but the point was to show you the bare minimum of what an npm package is made up of without any other tooling or project architecture muddying the waters.
    </p>

    <h3>A Bit More Advanced</h3>

    <p>
      In reality, your project is probably going to be much more complex than the simple example above.
      But now you know, in the back of your mind at least, what npm is looking for when you publish your package.
    </p>

    <p>
      To give a more advanced example of a real world package, I'm going to refer you to one of my own packages called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lernato/common" target="_blank">@lernato/common</a>.
      And here's a link to the source code on github: <a href="https://github.com/bjanderson/lernato-common" target="_blank">lernato-common</a> .
    </p>

    <p>
      In reality this is still a pretty minimal project in terms of functionality, but it does add in more of the things you will typically have in your project - such as tests, transpiling, tooling, and a more complex folder structure than the simple example above.
    </p>

    <p>
      First of all, there are many files and folders in this project that are necessary in terms of development, but that I don't want to include in my npm package, so we will have to make sure to exclude them when we publish.
      Also, I'm using TypeScript in this project, but I want to publish this project in a way that it is usable in regular JavaScript also, which means I will have to transpile my code before publishing it.
      And the last thing I want to point out is that the functionality for this package is contained in several different files and folders, but it is all exported through one top-level <code class="language-text">index.js</code> file.
    </p>

    <h4>Specify What To Include Or Exclude</h4>

    <p>
      By default, npm will generally include everything in your project when it publishes it.
      This includes tests, config files, scripts, etc...
      It does automatically exclude some things, such as your <code class="language-text">node_modules</code> folder, but you will typically want to trim down the amount of stuff that gets published into your package.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several methods available to define what you want to include in, or exclude from, your package.
      The method I use is to define the <code class="language-text">"files"</code> array in my package.json.
      Anything in that array will get included in my published package - given that it's not on the list of things that always get excluded.
      There are a lot of details surrounding this setting, so it's best if you read the docs for yourself (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files" target="_blank">https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files</a>).
      That being said I will mention that there are certain things that always get included in your package, and things that always get excluded from your package (details are in the docs).
      Npm will also exclude anything that's in your <code class="language-text">.gitignore</code> file.
      And you can create a <code class="language-text">.npmignore</code> file to define other things you want to exclude.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can work out what works best for you, but I find it easier to only define what I want included, which means I don't have to update all the ignore files every time I add a new file or folder that is for development use only.
    </p>

    <p>
      And, just to point out the obvious, you should make sure that you are including (or not excluding) the folder that contains the file that your <code class="language-text">"main"</code> field points to in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> file.
    </p>

    <h4>Preparing Your Project For Publishing</h4>

    <p>
      Unless you're brand new to JavaScript development, you know that there are many different tools and transpilers and pre-processors that your code must run through before it can actually run.
      The general standard is to store your source code in a folder named <code class="language-text">src</code> and your transpiled, processed, executable code in a folder named <code class="language-text">dist</code>.
      If your code needs to be processed before it can be executed, then you don't want to point your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> <code class="language-text">main</code> field to your <code class="language-text">src/index.js</code>, you want to point it to your <code class="language-text">dist/index.js</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, like me, you are using some other fancy language, such as TypeScript, to write your JavaScript, then you might also need to include things like type definitions in your published package.
      Thankfully, in the case of TypeScript at least, there's a field you can add to your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> called <code class="language-text">types</code>, which is kind of like <code class="language-text">main</code> except it points to your type definitions file - e.g. <code class="language-bash">"types": "dist/index.d.ts"</code>.
      This allows other projects that use TypeScript to import your package and automatically have all the types defined with it.
    </p>

    <h4>Package Naming</h4>

    <p>
      I also want to quickly touch on package naming.
      Packages named in the format <code class="language-text">@scope/package-name</code> are called scoped packages.
      You might wonder how to group your packages under a given package scope, like I have done with <code class="language-text">@lernato/common</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have a private repo in Verdaccio then package scopes are applied automatically based on the <code class="language-text">name</code> field in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> file.
      But, if you want to have scoped packages in the public npm repo, then you first have to create an organization for your scope on npmjs.com.
      For example, I had to create an organization named <em>lernato</em> in order for npmjs.com to recogize the @lernato scope in my packages.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the <code class="language-bash">npm publish</code> command will only allow you to use scoped packages if you have a paid account on npmjs.com.
      If you want to publish a scoped package with a free account then you have to add the <code class="language-bash">--access public</code> flag to your publish command.

      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm publish --access public
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Dependencies</h4>

    <p>
      When someone installs your npm package, npm will also install everything in your <code class="language-javascript">dependencies</code> array in <code class="language-text">package.json</code>.
      It won't install anything that's in your <code class="language-javascript">devDependencies</code> or <code class="language-javascript">peerDependencies</code> arrays.
      With that in mind, you should never put anything in your <code class="language-javascript">dependencies</code> array that isn't required by the project that consumes it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking this topic one step further, if you assume that the consumer of your package will already have a dependency installed you should put it in your package's <code class="language-javascript">peerDependencies</code> and <code class="language-javascript">devDependencies</code> and not in your <code class="language-javascript">dependencies</code> because it will inevitably cause version conflicts for your package's consumers.
      For example, if you create a package that has angular dependencies, then you can probably assume that the consuming project already has angular installed.
      If you were to put your angular dependencies in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> <code class="language-javascript">dependencies</code> then, when the consumer installs your package, they will automatically install the version of angular that's specified in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code>.
      If they already have angular installed and it's at a different version, they will get errors during the install, and they will get frustrated at you and probably choose not to use your package.
    </p>

    <p>
      To avoid this, you should always specify your package's dependencies in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> <code class="language-javascript">peerDependencies</code>, so that your package's consumer will get a warning if they do not have a compatible version of a dependency installed, but it won't send them down the rabbit hole of version errors.
      However, what you define in your <code class="language-text">package.json</code> <code class="language-javascript">peerDependencies</code> don't get installed when you run npm install.
      So, how do you get those dependencies installed so you can develop your library?
      The best advice I have found on this is to also include your <code class="language-javascript">peerDependencies</code> packages in your <code class="language-javascript">devDependencies</code>.
      That way they don't get installed by your package's consumer, your package's consumer still gets the version warning from your <code class="language-javascript">peerDependencies</code>, and the packages still get installed in your node_modules folder thanks to them being in your <code class="language-javascript">devDependencies</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And one final tip.
      You can, and I think should, lock your dependencies and devDependencies package versions to a specific version, and only upgrade them on purpose.
      However, you should not lock your peerDependencies down to one specific version, as that will also make your package's consumers unhappy by forcing them to use specific versions of their dependencies.
      Doing this will also quickly make your package incompatible with other packages that might not be on the same upgrade cycle as you.
      Let your peerDependencies package versions span the widest range that works, so that you can ensure maximum flexibility for those who use your package.
    </p>

    <h2>package.json</h2>

    <p>
      So, after all that explaining, here is a snippet from the package.json file from my lernato-common project.
      Note: I didn't have to include the package.json, README.md, and LICENSE files in my files array, but I put them there because it makes it easy for me to remember that they are included in the package, even though npm includes them automatically.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        "name": "@lernato/common",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "main": "dist/index.js",
        "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
        "files": [
          "dist/",
          "package.json",
          "README.md",
          "LICENSE"
        ],
        ...
      </code></pre>
      So, when you <code class="language-bash">npm install @lernato/common</code>, only the things that are in the files array get added to your node_modules folder.
      And when you <code class="language-javascript">import * from '@lernato/common'</code> in your project, you get whatever is exported through the dist/index.js file.

      When you are finally ready to publish your package to Verdaccio or npm, you should remember to test it, build it, rev the version, and finally publish it.
      All of this testing and building and versioning can lead to a lot of command typing if we let it.
      Fortunately, npm gives us a way to automate most of this work with scripts.
      The following is a snippet from how I like to set up my <code class="language-bash">package.json</code> scripts to handle my package build and deployment process.

      <pre><code class="language-json">
        "scripts": [
          "build": "[your build command here]",
          "prebuild": "npm test && rimraf dist/",
          "prepush": "npm run build",
          "push": "npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873",
          "push:major": "npm run version:major && npm run push",
          "push:minor": "npm run version:minor && npm run push",
          "push:patch": "npm run version:patch && npm run push",
          "test": "[your test command here]",
          "version:major": "npm version major --no-git-tag-version",
          "version:minor": "npm version minor --no-git-tag-version",
          "version:patch": "npm version patch --no-git-tag-version"
        ]
      </code></pre>

      Then, whenever I want to push a patch to my package I just run:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm run push:patch
      </code></pre>
      and my package is tested, built, versioned, and published - all with one command.
