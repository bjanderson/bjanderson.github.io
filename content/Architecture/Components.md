Work in progress...

If [[Models]] are the building blocks of your application, and [[Services]] are the plumbing, then Components are everything else inside the building.
They are the doors you walk through, the windows you look out and open, the refrigerator you browse through, the coffee pot, oven, sink...
UI components are what you use and interact with on a daily basis, and they are built with models, and powered by services.
