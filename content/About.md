I grew up in a small coal mining town where everyone worked some kind of blue-collar type of job.
I started mowing lawns and shovelling snow from a young age, maybe 12, maybe younger...
In my teens I worked on a farm, and I also learned carpentry and masonry from the men around me.
I was also the one in my family who figured out how to program the VCR, and I may have torn apart a Nintendo or two trying to figure out how they worked.

After high school I went to a trade school and got an associates degree in electronics.
Mind you, I didn't have the slightest desire to own a computer - I just noticed that electronics were taking over the world, so I thought it would be in my best interest to know how they worked.

Near the end of my two years in that school a few government contractors came to interview us, and one of them liked my construction background. I got hired to install bullet-proof doors and windows in US embassies. We also installed security cameras and other electronic things. And they trained me in welding.

It was around this time that I got my first computer, and my first copy of Microsoft Excel, and my first foray into programming - writing macros in VBA.

After a while I took a job designing security systems for US Attorney's offices around the states.
I got to work with blueprints and architects on a daily basis.
I also got to travel to perform site surveys and inspections.

One day I received a phone call from a company that found a copy of my resume online.
They said I had an interesting background and asked if I'd be willing to try to work on some special equipment that they needed to maintain.
It was an old (older than me) door closer system, with a hydraulic motor, big old electric relays, and other antiquated electrical components.

The guy who worked on them before me was one of the only people in the world who knew anything about the system.
He worked on it for 30 years, but passed away.
Unfortunately for them, he was illiterate so there wasn't any documentation on how the system worked.
He had a test bench set up for troublshooting parts that were shipped in from around the world, but nobody even knew how to turn it on.

They asked me if I could figure it out, and I told them to give me a volt meter and a month and I would do my best.
After a month or so of tinkering with that system I had created a detailed diagram of every circuit and moving part in the whole system.
I eventually turned that into a full troubleshooting manual, and, as far as I know, it's still being used around the world to maintain that sytem.

It was during my time working there that I started to really get into programming.
After I fixed their backlog of broken parts I ended up having quite a bit of free time at work.
My boss told me he viewed my like a firefighter.
He said you don't always need them around, but you sure do want them there when you need them.

So I started doing handyman stuff around the warehouse we were in.
Any time anyone needed anything built or fixed or modified, they'd come to me and I'd gladly work on it.
I also did plenty of studying on the web - exploring whatever topics piqued my interest at the time.
Eventually I got curious about how the internet worked, and started digging in to every aspect of computers and networks.

I eventually asked my boss if I could work part time and go to college full time - and he approved.
So, at the age of 27, I signed up for community college.
I initally started going for civil engineering, but my infatuation with the web took over and I switched to computer science.
