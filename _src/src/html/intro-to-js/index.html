    <h1>JavaScript</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      JavaScript is like any other programming language, and like no other programming language.
      It is like all the others in that it has if's, and for's, and other typical things you would expect in a programming language.
      It is like no other in that it alone is the language that all browsers support - making it the defacto standard for web development.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are going to be a web developer, you should learn, and never stop learning, the JavaScript programming language.
      And I don't mean learn how to stitch together various JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
      I mean learn the actual language.
      Know what it can do, and how it does it.
      Aim to know how all of those other libraries and frameworks work under the hood.
      This investment will pay dividends for the rest of your career - it certainly has for mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing you should know about JavaScript is that it is not technically named JavaScript.
      The language is actually named ECMAScript.
      Why it's called JavaScript instead of ECMAScript is a long and interesting story about politics and marketing that took place during the 1990s, but what we tend to call JavaScript is technically ECMAScript.
      If you want to find out more about the history of JavaScript, you can start at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>, and then <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=history+of+javascript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google it</a> from there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The language itself is actually defined in a standard (ECMA-262), but is implemented on a case-by-case basis by those who use it.
      The standard is an evolving document that can be found on github at: <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/tc39/ecma262</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The major browsers use the following implementations of that standard
      <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome: <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">V8</a></li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpiderMonkey</a></li>
        <li>Internet Explorer/Edge: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChakraCore</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The implementors all use the same standard (more or less), but they all write their own code to implement that standard, and so they each have their own bugs and quirks.
      If you ever want to know if the browsers you are targeting have implemented the standard for the features you want to use, you can easily check that on this site: <a href="https://caniuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://caniuse.com/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are new to JavaScript, or you haven't already read them, I highly recommend working your way through Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" books (free on github - <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS</a>).
      I can't think of a better resource to get you started with a good depth of knowledge about JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      And, since you're most likely going to be working with HTML and CSS in addition to JavaScript, I recommend getting familiar with those standards too.
