      Hello
    </p>

    <p class="center">
      Welcome to PracticalWebDev.com
    </p>

    <p class="center">
      My name is BJ Anderson, and I am a JavaScript enthusiast!
    </p>

    <p>
      I started programming in JavaScript in 2006 using nothing but IE6 and Notepad.
      The thing about JavaScript that really got me into it was the fact that I could program with it on any computer that had a text editor and a browser, which is pretty much all of them.
      I didn't have to install anything, or use any special programs to run my code.
      I could just tinker around with it at will.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I first started learning JavaScript, I was actually going to college for Civil Engineering.
      But once I got hooked on programming, it was a no-brainer for me to change majors to Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      After I graduated with my BS in Computer Science in 2012, I got a job creating web games for a Christmas themed website.
      I was the only developer assigned to the project and I got to start from scratch.
      I could not resist the challenge to write every bit of code without any 3rd party libraries (not even jQuery).
      I met the challenge, including 100% support for the top 5 browsers at the time - complete with end-to-end tests, and even received an award for my work.
      Needless to say, I learned a lot about JavaScript and web-development from that experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      From there I was assigned to be the only UI developer on a project that was creating satellite mapping tools that integrated with Google Earth.
      I had a blast with that, and got my first taste of d3js on that project too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then I've worked on many different projects using a wide variety of tools - npm, grunt, gulp, jspm, webpack, etc... - and frameworks - jQuery, backbone, knockout, EXTjs, AngularJS (1), React, Angular (2+)...
    </p>

    <p>
      And with NodeJS making it possible to write JavaScript on the back-end, I have enjoyed writing entire web applications, front to back, in my language of choice.
      I couldn't be happier. ...well, ok, I could be happier if IE would work...
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't know if I love JavaScript because I'm a web developer, or if I'm a web developer because I love JavaScript.
      Either way, that's who I am.
