    <h1>Intro To JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming language. It's primarily used for building web
      applications, but can be used to develop anything from desktop
      applications to artificial intelligence. It's one of the easiest
      programming languages to learn because all you need to get started is a
      web browser. Of course, it's better if you have a good text editor too,
      but you can actually write working JavaScript code in the Developer Tools
      Console, right inside your browser. And that's actually how I got started
      learning it back in 2006.

      Because JavaScript is the language that's used most by web developers, and
      the web is exactly the place you are likely to look for information about
      it, you will find tons of information about JavaScript on the web. I am a
      web developer, and I am creating this tutorial about JavaScript because
      that's what I do, and what I know the most about. If you want to join the
      web developer ranks, then let's get started.

      I mentioned that all you need to write JavaScript is a web browser, so
      let's start there. I should add the caveat that you're going to need to be
      on a laptop or desktop - this won't work on a phone or tablet. Also, I'm
      using Brave as my browser. You can use pretty much any browser you want
      (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc...), and still be able to follow along
      though.

      Since you're probably reading this in a web browser you can just press the
      F12 key to open up the "Dev Tools Console." You can also click on the
      settings menu (top-right corner) and look for the Developer Tools in
      there. The exact location will depend on what browser you are using.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you get the Dev Tools panel opened, you will see a number of Tabs
      such as, Elements, Sources, Console, Network, etc... Click on the Console
      tab, and you should see a blinking cursor. It will be at the bottom of any
      messages that are printed in the console. There should also be a button in
      the toolbar at the top of the console to "Clear Console." You can click
      that to get rid of the noise.
