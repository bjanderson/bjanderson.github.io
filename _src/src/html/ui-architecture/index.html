    <h1>UI Architecture</h1>

    <!--
    Note to self: describe how architecture evolves as you go from simply requesting and displaying a static html page,
    through the variations on submitting form data and showing a new or updated page,
    to the modern single page application.
    -->

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Reliable
        <ul>
        <li>Validate input from the user</li>
        <li>Validate input from the server</li>
        <li>Set reasonable default values that will not break the code (e.g. no NPEs, no objects where arrays are expected, etc...)</li>
        <li>Set reasonable default values that will not appear as abnormal to the user (e.g. do not show "undefined" or "NaN", avoid showing true/false, etc...)</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>Consistent
        <ul>
          <li>Present data to the user in a consistent manner across the application
            <ul>
              <li>Dates formatted the same</li>
              <li>Numbers that are rounded (likely should be rounded everywhere)</li>
              <li>Full Name (composed of first name, last name, etc...)</li>
              <li>Addresses (composed of associated parts)</li>
              <li>Computed values (dates from numbers, high/med/low based on number range, etc...)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Views stay fresh (show updated data)</li>
          <li>No unnecessary server calls</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Robust
        <ul>
          <li>Invalid data does not break the UI</li>
          <li>Errors do not break the UI</li>
          <li>Error messages are presented consistently</li>
          <li>Help is given as much as possible with errors (fill in required field, refresh the browser, contact support, etc...)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Maintainable
        <ul>
          <li>Use consistent, understandable patterns throughout the code to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability</li>
          <li>Modularize/Compartmentalize code to be reusable and do one thing only</li>
          <li>No monolith structures - break things up into components, and compose components of components</li>
          <li>Follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't Repeat Yourself</a> (DRY) principle - don't write the same functionality over and over again throughout your code, put it in one place and let everything that needs it use it from there.</li>
          <li>Follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Single Responsibility Principle</a> (SRP) - functions should do one thing only</li>
          <li>Follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Law of Demeter</a> - do not chain function calls, do not return functions from functions, don't talk to strangers</li>
          <li>Functions should either modify state, or return state - not both</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Testable
        <ul>
          <li>Use dependency injection as much as possible</li>
          <li>Functions should be short and do one thing only - if you have more than 3 or 4 tests for a function consider breaking it up into smaller functions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Secure
        <ul>
          <li>See OWASP (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page</a>)</li>
          <li>Validate user input</li>
          <li>Use proper techniques for averting attacks from the client</li>
          <li>Don't give too much information in error messages (don't expose your architecture through stack traces, etc...)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
