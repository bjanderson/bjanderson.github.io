    <h1>How To Create An NPM Package</h1>

    <p>
      If you're a developer, chances are that you interact with the open-source community.
      You probably use a few (...hundred? ...thousand?) open-source projects on a daily basis.
      And you probably intend to contribute to the open source community someday - whenever you get time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, that describes me anyways, and now is the time for getting some contributions under my belt.
    </p>

    <p>
      So how <em>does</em> one go about contributing to the open-source community, exactly?
      You could volunteer to write documentation.
      You could volunteer to write tests.
      You could even volunteer to be a beta user and possibly submit some bug fixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Or, you could create something all your own, and become a full-blown open-source author.
      And that's exactly what I intend to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      OK.
      So, all-in it is.
      But how?...
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, to begin with, make sure you have git installed.
      Head over to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> and get the version that's right for your operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you're going to need a couple of accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      First create a github account at <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>, if you don't already have one.
      Github is where pretty much everyone keeps their open-source source code.
      As you start writing code that you want to share with the rest of the world, you will create repos here, and publish your code in them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then go to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npmjs.com</a> and create a user account there, if you haven't already.
      Npmjs.com is where pretty much everyone publishes their open-source packages for others to install and import into their projects.
      As you build working code that you want to make available for others to use in their projects, you will publish it here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you're going to need to create something.
      It doesn't have to be complicated.
      For example, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/isarray">this project</a> is basically 4 lines of code.
