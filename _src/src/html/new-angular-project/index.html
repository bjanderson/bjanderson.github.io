    <h1>New Angular Project</h1>

    <p>
      If you're new to Angular, I highly recommend taking a walk through the tutorial at <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://angular.io/tutorial</a>.
      The first part of the tutorial is instructions on how to install Node and Angular, and get things running.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, this will not be an in-depth article since the tutorial and the Angular docs already do a good job of covering that.
      I will simply give you a quick overview of how I get a new Angular project started.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      The first step in starting a new Angular project is to install the Angular cli.
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        npm i -g @angular/cli@latest
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      Then you can easily generate a new project using the cli
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        ng new my-project --prefix=myprj --style=scss --routing=true
      </code></pre>

      The options tell Angular to set some configuration settings for your project.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>--prefix</em> tells angular that all of your component html tags will be prefixed with myprj-.
          This will be checked at build time and during linting.
          You want to set this to something that will differentiate your components from any other angular or third party components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>--style</em> tells Angular to use SCSS as the css pre-processor for your project.
          It will automatically set up the build chain for this and create all of your stylesheets as .scss files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>--routing</em> tells angular to generate boiler-plate code for setting up routing for your application.
        </li>
      </ul>

      There are other options available.
      You can see the full list in the docs at <a href="https://angular.io/cli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://angular.io/cli</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      Once you generate your new project, you can cd into your project directory and run it.
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        cd my-project
        npm start
      </code></pre>

      And your project will be hosted at http://localhost:4200/
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      If you plan to use Angular Material then now is the time to install that.
      Thankfully, Angular offers a convenient way to add it to your project
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
        ng add @angular/material
      </code></pre>

      I usually answer yes to all the prompts, but feel free to dig in to the details at <a href="https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics</a>
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      From here, you can start building your application.
      If you want to take advantage of Angular CLI's built in schematics check out the docs at <a href="https://angular.io/cli/generate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://angular.io/cli/generate</a>
    </p>

    <p class="step">
      And, don't forget to take a look inside the package.json file to see what commands are configured out of the box.
      There are commands for building, linting, testing, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of this is just scratching the surface of what is possible with Angular.
      After running through these steps, you should have a good idea of the basic steps to get a simple Angular application up and running.
      If, like me, you're planning to build large scale applications with Angular, you will want to build up a much larger ecosystem of tools to help you along in your creative process.
      And we will cover all of that in the posts to come.
